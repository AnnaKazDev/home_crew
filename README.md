## Project Description
Home Crew lets up to 10 family members share a **To Do / Done** board for each day, choose from **50 predefined tasks** or add custom ones, drag-and-drop to update status, and assign who is responsible—all backed by Supabase. The system logs every action and supports English UI with full responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Key features  
- Admin creates a household and invites members via a 6-digit PIN  
- Email/password authentication with password-reset flow  
- Daily calendar view with “To Do” and “Done” columns  
- Drag-and-drop or click to mark tasks complete  
- Task assignment to any household member  
- Points accumulate for completed chores (gamification; reward UI post-MVP)  
- Audit log stored in PostgreSQL  
- GDPR-compliant data storage & right-to-erasure

_Target success metric_: **≥ 2 chores added per active member per day**.

## Tech Stack

### Front-end
- **Astro 5** – static site generator with island architecture  
- **React 19** (islands) – interactive components (drag-and-drop, modals)  
- **TypeScript 5** – static typing  
- **Tailwind CSS 4** – utility-first styling  
- **shadcn/ui** – accessible component library

### Back-end
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL, RLS, auth, audit)  
- Optional realtime channels for live status updates

### Tooling & Infrastructure
- **OpenRouter.ai** – multi-provider LLM gateway  
- **GitHub Actions** – lint → test → build → preview → staging → production  
- **Docker** – container image (Astro Node adapter)  
- **DigitalOcean** – hosting & managed Postgres/Supabase Cloud

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Node 22.14.0**  
  ```bash
  nvm install 22.14.0
  nvm use 22.14.0
  ```
- **Supabase CLI** (for local development)
  ```bash
  npm install -g supabase
  # or
  brew install supabase/tap/supabase
  ```

### Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/home-crew.git
cd home-crew

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install      # or pnpm install

# 3. Initialize Supabase (if not already done)
supabase init

# 4. Start Supabase locally
supabase start

# 5. Run database migrations
supabase db reset --local

# Optional: Disable RLS for development (removes all security policies)
# supabase migration up --include-all  # Run all migrations including development ones

# 6. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env   # add local Supabase keys from step 4

# 7. Start dev server
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3001 to view the app.

### Database Management

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Control

Your project includes special migrations to control database security policies per environment:

##### **Production Mode (Default - Recommended)**
When you run standard migrations, RLS is **enabled** with full security policies:
```bash
# Standard setup with RLS enabled
supabase db reset --local          # Local development
supabase db reset --linked         # Production/staging
```
✅ **RLS enabled** - full data security
✅ **Security policies** active
✅ **Data protected** per user/household

##### **Development Mode (Optional)**
For easier development and testing, you can disable RLS to access all data freely:
```bash
# 1. First run standard migrations
supabase db reset --local

# 2. Then disable RLS for development
supabase migration up --file 20241013000000_disable_rls_for_development.sql
```
⚠️  **RLS disabled** - full access to all data
⚠️  **No security restrictions**
⚠️  **Local development only!**

##### **Restore Production Security**
To re-enable RLS after development work:
```bash
# Restore full security
supabase migration up --file 20241014000000_reenable_rls_for_production.sql
```
✅ **RLS re-enabled**
✅ **All security policies** restored

##### **When to Use Each Mode**

| Environment | RLS Status | Usage |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Production** | ✅ Enabled | Always - security critical |
| **Staging** | ✅ Enabled | Security testing |
| **Local Dev** | ❌ Disabled | Easy testing, debugging |
| **Local Dev** | ✅ Enabled | Testing security features |

### Building for production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # Local preview of production build
```
