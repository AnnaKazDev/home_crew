## Project Description
Home Crew lets up to 10 family members share a **To Do / Done** board for each day, choose from **50 predefined tasks** or add custom ones, drag-and-drop to update status, and assign who is responsible‚Äîall backed by Supabase. The system logs every action and supports English UI with full responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Key features  
- Admin creates a household and invites members via a 6-digit PIN  
- Email/password authentication with password-reset flow  
- Daily calendar view with ‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù and ‚ÄúDone‚Äù columns  
- Drag-and-drop or click to mark tasks complete  
- Task assignment to any household member  
- Points accumulate for completed chores (gamification; reward UI post-MVP)  
- Audit log stored in PostgreSQL  
- GDPR-compliant data storage & right-to-erasure

_Target success metric_: **‚â• 2 chores added per active member per day**.
